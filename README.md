This project aims to provide some implementations of the most typical reinforcement learning algorithms.

# Algorithms Implemented

- DQN
- Prioritized DQN
- Rainbow
- IQN
- A2C
- PPO
- DDPG

# Built-in Experiments

Some built-in experiments are exported to help new users to easily run benchmarks with one line (for example, ``run(E`JuliaRL_BasicDQN_CartPole`)``). For experienced users, you are suggested to check [the source code](https://github.com/JuliaReinforcementLearning/ReinforcementLearningZoo.jl/tree/master/src/experiments) of those experiments and make changes as needed.

**Notes:**

- Experiments on `CartPole` usually run faster with CPU only due to the overhead of sending data between CPU and GPU.
- It shouldn't surprise you that our experiments on `CartPole` are much faster than those written in Python. The secret is that our environment is written in Julia!
- Remember to set `JULIA_NUM_THREADS` to enable multi-threading when using algorithms like `A2C` and `PPO`.
- Experiments on `Atari` are only available when you have `ArcadeLearningEnvironment.jl` installed and `using ArcadeLearningEnvironment`.
- Different configurations might affect the performance a lot. According to our tests, our implementations are generally comparable to those written in PyTorch or TensorFlow with the same configuration (sometimes we are significantly faster).
